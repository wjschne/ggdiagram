* This is a new release.
* Removed reference to the package name from the Description field. 
* Description field has more details about what the package does.
* Removed unnecessary messages to the console. There are some remaining uses of `cat` for the `print` and `str` methods for the object classes. These were modeled after the `str` methods for S7 objects.
