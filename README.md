The ggdiagram package takes an object-oriented approach to making diagrams (using [S7](https://rconsortium.github.io/S7/index.html)) and plots the results using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

This package is in a very preliminary state. It has some structural beams and a bit of plumbing but is not yet capable of fulfilling its eventual purpose. 

My motivation in making ggdiagram was to find a way to approach the functionality of Tikz but with the convenience, speed, flexibility of R. The ggdiagram package is built on top of S7 and ggplot2, making use of ggarrow and ggtext.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggpathdiagramr like so:

``` r
